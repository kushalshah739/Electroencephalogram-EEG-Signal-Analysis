# Electroencephalogram-EEG-Signal-Analysis
The purpose of this lab is to examine EEG signals and process them to find the four main components of the signal. Firstly, we looked at the frequency range of a typical EEG signal. This range was used to create a denoise filter, which was used in every process of the lab. The range used for the filter was 0.5-30Hz, which was outlined as the best range in the lab manual. The bandpass filter we used was a Chebyshev 1 tenth order filter, and the cutoff frequencies were 0.5Hz and 30Hz as previously outlined. We used this filter because in the previous lab we determined it was the best for biomedical signals. With the filtered signals, we then proceeded to find the four characteristic waves of the EEG signal. Them being the alpha (8-13Hz), beta (13-22Hz), delta (0.5-4Hz), and theta (4-8Hz) waves. Similarly, Chebyshev 1 tenth order bandpass filters were used to find these waves.
